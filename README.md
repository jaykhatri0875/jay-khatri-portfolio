# Full Stack ML engineer

#### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, Scala, Spark, pytorch, Backend development, computer vision methods, NLP,databases (postgres, oracle, teradata, MySQL, MS-SQL), Docker, CI CD - jenkins,GCP, AWS, Snowflake, ETL

## These are some of my projects

## [Document chat & summarization using LLM and Vector database using RAG architecture]
* Built chat and summarization application using LLM using python, Azure APIs, vector store, document extraction, GPT4/4o

## [Document classification using VGG16 model]
* As part of automating process flow, Built an classification system with 70+ labeled document dataset using VGG CNN architecture
* Technologies used : Python, pytorch, FastAPI, Postgres DB, jenkins, GCP, Kubernetes, Docker

## [Key information extraction from Documents]
* As part of automating process flow, built key information Extraction using various image processing and OCR methods
* Technologies used : python, tesseract, open-cv, OCR, layoutLM, fastAPI,,jenkins, GCP, Kubernetes, Docker


## [Chatbot for BI reports](https://github.com/jaykhatri0875) 
![Chatbot design]()
* Designed and build chatbot to ease the access of BI reports in HSBC
* This was proposed as internal innovation, because there are lot of reports generated and it is intended for different end users, and users check 2-3 metrics (operational metrics such as TATs, SLAs etc). A chatbot can work as intermediatory tool, which can answer KPIs live reduce the hassle of applying lot of filters to get KPI. 
* Built a client facing API using flask, and chatbot using rasa, spacy combination, mainly NER. deployed it over windows IIS server within HSBC. front end using html,css,js,ajax & D3.js for charts. 

## [Data engineering - Event modeling)](https://github.com/jaykhatri0875)
![Event model]()
* Working on event model, which is designed to store various source systems in single generic data model. Stored data will provide advanced analytics capabilities such as tracing events across systems (for example, payments to query to payments)
* This is built on spark & hadoop ecosystem, where pipelines are build & deployed with scala-spark. source system analysis is done using SQL, pyspark, pandas etc. 
* I came up with data analyst & data engineer workflow, and how to tackle any system to event model for business requirements. 

## [WOTR backend - Django](https://github.com/jaykhatri0875) 
* Worked on CSR project for WOTR organisation, where we designed and built mobile appllication for jalsevaks in remote villages, which help peeople to keep track of water & other natural resources for farming activites. It was done with collaboration of people from various teams within HSBC and individual contributors for WOTR.
* I worked on backend part of application, which was built on Django, postgres, AWS lambda & EC2, AWS api gateway. 

## [Pyano](https://github.com/jaykhatri0875/pyano)
![Pyano](https://github.com/jaykhatri0875/pyano/blob/master/sample/pressed.png)
* It is fun project in covid where i wanted to learn some new instrument, but tried to build new kind of instrument which is air piano !
* It is built using mediapipe, python, opencv. learned to fix together bunch of code in computer vision and it was ready to play some tunes.(do check it out if you're interested ) 

## [Sepsis prediction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO7qGea7saE&ab_channel=jaykhatri)
![flowchart](https://github.com/jaykhatri0875/jay-khatri-portfolio/blob/main/flowdiagram.png)
* This is final year project for BE, where we learned basics of feature engineering, deep learning and ML algorithms. 
* This project is built using MIMIC III, open source public healthcare data set and inspired from GSOC problem statement
* We analysed the data for sepsis and came with 94 features to train model on, trained 5 layer Neural network to get accuracy of ~78% and deployed the model for users to use over APIs.
